# NLP-analysis-of-Restaurant-reviews
Natural language processing of Restaurant Reviews using Machine Learning.
Ther are many youtube videos on this topic which can help understand the code and also the way NLP works.
There are many other classifiers which can be used such as Naive Bayes,Decision Tree etc.
There are 3 files containing code,dataset,presentation.
